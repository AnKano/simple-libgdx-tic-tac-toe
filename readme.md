# Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Android application based on LibGDX and SocketIO

  - I was too lazy to do it properly
  - This breaks all patterns
  - ... But, come on, it's working!

# Using, installing, testing... keking
Without a server, it will be stuck in the lobby activity. For starting this shit just follow https://github.com/Rillatile/X0Server and run this server using this command...
```sh
$ node index.js
```
... and change IP-address in io/ash/simpletoe/Constansts.java
```
class Constants {
    static final String SERVER_URI = "http://localhost:8080";
}
```
If it's don't run tests just setup in Android JUnit Tests Working directory to '\android\assets'... 

# Licenses
Use it. Copy it. Clone it. Fix it. Modify it. I don't give a fuck. Absolutely copyleft. Use it freely.
